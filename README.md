# NEAT_Cars
    
    For some time, I’ve been interested in deep learning through backpropagation & gradient descent. Although not as popular as the previously mentioned method, I think it’s really cool how  genetic algorithms incorporate concepts from biology into a method of computation. So I decided to create some sort of artificial intelligence project that uses a genetic algorithm to evolve artificial neural networks.

    With all of the enthusiasm around Tesla and their self-driving cars, it felt fitting for the ANNs to be trained to drive simulated two-dimensional cars.


**Goal:** Use NEAT to evolve artificial neural networks that have the ability to perform three driving tasks.
1. Steer a car around a curved course.
2. Park a car in a specific position & orientation.
3. Merge into oncoming highway traffic from an on-ramp.
