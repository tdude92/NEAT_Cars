# NEAT_Cars

  I wanted to make a project using genetic algorithms for a long time so I decided to write an implementation of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) and train it to do something.

  I'm a Tesla fanboy so it's about cars.


**Goal:** Use NEAT to evolve artificial neural networks that have the ability to steer a 2D car around curved courses.
