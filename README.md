# NEAT_Cars
    
  For some time, I’ve been interested in deep learning through backpropagation & gradient descent. Although not as popular as the previously mentioned method, I think it’s really cool how genetic algorithms incorporate concepts from biology into a method of computation. So I decided to create some sort of artificial intelligence project that uses a genetic algorithm to evolve artificial neural networks.

  I'm a Tesla fanboy so it's about cars.


**Goal:** Use NEAT to evolve artificial neural networks that have the ability to steer a 2D car around curved courses.
